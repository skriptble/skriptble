## Hello üëãüèæ
I'm a writer, software developer, and community organizer. I've specialized in distributed systems for most of my software career but have also dabbled in relational theory, hypermedia web APIs, web components, and the process of software engineering.

After nearly a decade designing and building distributed systems, I've became frustrated with the status quo of distributed systems literature and teaching material. So I decided to start a new adventure, one where I go back to my roots as a writer and attempt to teach the world about computing and distributed systems.

Even a decade of experience with distributed systems hasn't taught me everything, so I've chosen to take a unique approach of learning in public, with the hope that doing so will leave a trail to assist others in demystifying this area of computing.

I also have another lofty goal: to become a full stack software engineer. No, not the traditional frontend/backend stack, but instead a transistors all the way up full stack. I want to prove to the world that it's possible for one person to learn all of it. You can hear me talk about this more on [Changelog & Friends #12](https://changelog.com/friends/12).

To pursue my goals, I decided to start a digital publishing company. You can visit [Skriptble Publishing Inc.'s website](https://skriptblepublishing.com) to find out more. I've written more about my personal motivations behind this endeavor in [this Shaded Garden entry](https://garden.skriptble.press/entry/who-am-i-why-am-i-doing-this/).
